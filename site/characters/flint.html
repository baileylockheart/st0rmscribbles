                <p class="desc">Flint was initially supposed to be a larksona with a lynx mask, but as I made a Pinterest board for him, I realized that general atmosphere didn't fit what I wanted for him. Still, I kept the small handful of traits I'd already chosen for him at that point, such as the fact that I knew he'd be an artist and a bit of a loner. Generally, he floats around the outside of friend groups. He likes the idea of friend groups, and finds vague comfort in people watching, but also hates talking to people. It's almost confusing to people in the friend groups he hangs around. He seems quite content and interested when everyone else is talking, but the second someone tries to pull him into the conversation, he backs out completely and isolates to somewhere he can draw quietly. (Despite trying to go unnoticed, he has the chunkiest sketchbooks possible, mainly because he draws in pen 90% of the time and just carries around sticky notes to hide his mistakes.) He's equally afraid of being seen as he is of never being known, and that conflict is the subtle center of his day-to-day, present but so constant he sometimes forgets it's there. Remembering is the worst part. </p>
