                <p class="desc">Tirian is more of a concept than a character right now, said concept being "agoraphobic Disney prince". Generally, he's the Disney prince I needed - transmasculine and dealing with an anxiety disorder. He's aware of his priviledge and position, and knows he's safe where he is. Despite that, he knows he wants to leave - he wants to leave the castle and learn about the world, he want that desperately... But he can't bring himself to leave. It's happened multiple times, where he packs a bag and gets himself excited for the adventure ahead of him, before freezing at the door.</p>
                <p class="desc">In the song I've posted a demo for, he's been kidnapped, but it's unclear as to why. His captor claims to have his best interest at heart, but also seems oddly set on having him cross the border to a different kingdom. The song takes place after Tirian effectively has an anxiety attack, this being his first time outside the castle since early childhood - I imagine it starting in front of a small fire, with him somewhat curled in on himself. His captor tries and fails to excite him about the opportunity he's been given, and instead offers him a deal - come explore with his captor, and said captor will bring him home safely once they're done. As for whether or not the captor means what he says? We'll see.</p>
