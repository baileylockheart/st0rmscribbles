                <p class="quote">I remember them all. I carry them with me every day, but they don't weigh me down. Feelings of grief may be heavy, but I do not blame them for that. How could I? I love them.</p>
                <p class="desc">Nikolaos, or Niko, is an OC inspired by EPIC: The Musical! He's one of the 600 men of Odysseus's fleet! He's half water nymph, half human, although neither he nor his parents are aware of this. (Said parents are not biologically related to him, they found and took him in as a baby.)</p>
                <p class="desc">Due to his father being very ill, he joined the war at only 10 years old. He was practically raised by his crew, seeing Odysseus and Polites in particular as father-like figures. Being 20 at the beginning of EPIC, he's grown and matured into a young man with an incredible capacity for kindness, as well as an equally incredible capacity for violence. Of the two, though, he would always choose kindness. He's undyingly loyal to his captain and crew, and is always eager to help. Despite the horrible things he'd seen at such a young age, he maintained a genuinely positive outlook and demeanor.</p>
                <p class="desc">He was known by the crew as a source of joy and a ray of sunshine. Being favored by Apollo certainly helped with that, but he'd have earned that title regardless. As a child, he'd sing to himself for comfort, and this habit grew with him as time passed&mdash;he'd come up with many songs that most of the crew can now recognize, and they found both comfort and entertainment in his antics.</p>
