                <p class="desc">While Elaila is many things, she's primarily a tarot reader. While she can do paid readings and such, it's more of something she learned and developed for her own sake. It took far longer to learn than she would've liked, since she used to quit whenever a reading was either scarily accurate or not at all what she wanted. As of now, she's both dedicated and confident, and therefore more stable in her growth. This applies to several areas of her life, always quitting things early on, only to return later and fully learn the skills required to do them well - this often earns her judgement from others, but she couldn't care less, knowing that by the end of the process, she'll be happier <i>and</i> more skilled than the ones who don't try to learn at all. She's also a bit of a night owl - sometimes she's simply appreciating the alone time and the moonlight, other times she's deep-diving into a subject she first heard about an hour ago, but no matter what, she always has some kind of music playing as she does it. She has many playlists for many moods, and refuses to put them on shuffle, as she lined the songs up in order to make a bit of a "plot" that can be followed from one song to the next. Overall, her life is calm and quiet, but never silent or stagnant. Between the periods of short-lived chaos, there's a certain peace to it, that despite her introversion, she hopes to someday share.</p>
